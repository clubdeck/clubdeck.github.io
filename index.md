## 🔥 Super powers for content creators on Clubhouse 🦸💪🚀

With Clubdeck, you can do pretty much the same things you would do on the smartphone apps, with additional key features and a totally different user experience, especially if you are a content creator:
* 🎙️ Use a professional microphone or sound card to maximise audio quality. You can even reroute audio through software like Loopback or Blackhole! Possibilities are endless.
* 🎧 Music mode: stream in stereo, 48kHz and 128kbps - no special cables required.
* 🎵 Play custom sounds and jingles, from local files or directly from YouTube.
* ✨ Apply real-time audio effects (voice changer, room reverb).
* 🔴 Record a Clubhouse room in lossless stereo .wav or compressed mono .aac, restream it to 30+ social networks (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter etc.).
* 💬 Manage your room or house chats like you've done it all your life.
* 🎬 Record highlights of your room in real-time (short video clips that you can share on social media).
* 🏡 Manage your houses, set up events in one click. Save templates for recurring events. View multiple houses at once!
* 💬 Set up a back channel chat to coordinate live with co-moderators.
* 💡 Find key people to invite on stage by browsing your audience's bios in a breeze.
* 🔔 Ping multiple people to your room with ease.
* 📰 Browse rooms, events, houses and people to follow, from the comfort of your Mac or PC.
* ⌨️ Use shortcuts to navigate and moderate Clubhouse like a boss.
* 🔎 Search rooms, users, houses, events... anything.
* 🎛️ Pin room searches to columns, apply custom highlighting and notification filters: marketing experts, this is for you!
* 📍 Pin links at the top of your room, easily copy / paste from your browser.
* ✍️ Add a live transcript at the top of your room with our Otter.ai integration.
* 📼 Manage your Clubhouse replays in a few clicks.
* ☀️ Pick your favorite light, dark or system theme.

## 🎙️ How to mix voice + external audio into Clubhouse

Mixing voice + external audio into Clubhouse is very easy with Clubdeck, and possibilities are endless - you can follow [this step by step tutorial](https://vowe.net/2022/01/02/mixing-voice-and-music-for-clubdeck-in-software/) for a good setup.

* On Mac, you can use [Loopback](https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/), [Blackhole](https://existential.audio/blackhole/) or [VB-Audio cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)
* On PC, we recommend [Voicemeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm)

## Troubleshooting

Note: if you have just registered an account, you must log in once in the iOS or android app before using Clubdeck.

If you are having microphone or connection issues we recommend the following steps:
1. reboot your computer
2. clear your cache (via the Help! menu at the top)
3. switch or desactivate your VPN if applicable
4. whitelist Clubdeck in your firewall rules - for example, see this link for [Norton](https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v6958602)
5. Download [Warp by Cloudflare](https://one.one.one.one/) to make sure your dns resolver is compatible with Clubhouse
6. If you are on Windows and using an ASIO compatible soundcard or mixer, you might need to install VB-Audio ASIO bridge that you will find [at the bottom of this page](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) - if you are a professional in the audio space, please bear in mind you need to be familiar enough with your equipment, we cannot help you troubleshoot specific issues not related directly to Clubdeck

If you are having display issues on Windows, you most probably need to update your drivers.

* [Click here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/intel-driver-support-assistant.html) if your PC runs on Intel
* [Click here](https://www.amd.com/en/support) if your PC runs on AMD

You can also try to change the resolution of your screen, and adjust the zoom in Clubdeck by going to View > Zoom In / Out at the top menu.

If you are experiencing crashes on an M1 Mac, some specific system libraries may not be entirely up to date - the solution is to enable "Open with Rosetta" for Clubdeck as described [on this page](https://support.apple.com/HT211861)
