# üëãClubhouse ‚ù§Ô∏è desktop, available on Mac and PC

Clubdeck is **not** affiliated with Clubhouse.
Yet, our enthusiasm for Clubhouse, combined with a few nights and week-ends spent in front of a computer ended up with Clubdeck, a
brand new way to browse, use, and enjoy Clubhouse on your Mac or PC.

# What can you do with Clubdeck?

Pretty much the same things you would do on the App, but on a much bigger screen and with a different approach when it comes to
user experience:
* Browse rooms, events, clubs and people to follow, from the comfort of your Mac or PC. 
* Stream custom sounds and jingles, manage your clubs and events, or use a backchannel to discuss live with co-moderators. 
* Plug a custom microphone or soundcard.
* Record a clubhouse room, restream it to 30+ social networks and transcribe it in real-time.
