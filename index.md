# Clubdeck : CH meets desktop

To start with: Clubdeck is **not** affiliated with Clubhouse.
Yet, our enthusiasm for Clubhouse, combined with a few nights and week-ends spent in font of a computer ended up with Clubdeck, a
brand new way to browse, use, and enjoy Clubhouse on your desktop.

# What can you do with Clubdeck?

Pretty much the same things that you would do on the App, albeit on a much bigger screen and with a different approach when it comes to
UX. Clubdeck is very useful to browse rooms, find interesting events, clubs and people to follow, from the comfort of your Mac or PC.

# I want it!

No problem, we understand ðŸ˜‹

You can download Cludeck below:
